# word-anagram

A simple script to look for anagram in Italian language. Mainly written in order to learn Pearl language.

This can be used by running the following script:
```
perl main.pl
```
and following the commands.

By changing the `data/vocab.txt` file you can insert custom data. The current vocabulary is a list of Italian words, so feel free to change it with whatever you want.
